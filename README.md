# Target ATC Extension

An extension for [Target](https://www.target.com) that adds items to the cart and bypasses pages, allowing users to checkout items very fast.

## Instructions

1. Extract and unload this extension into your browser.
2. Go to [Target](https://www.target.com) and get the product page of the item you want to purchase and refresh. If you already have the product link, you can load that link without the need to refresh.
3. The extension should then do its thing and take you straight to the checkout page where you confirm your order.
